* Assumptions:
* * Only successful (accepted) transactions are considered.
* * The transaction date reflects when it happened (happened_at), not when it was created.
* * "Average" refers to the average, not the median (p50).
* Notes:
* * Additional fields have been added to mart_store in case we want to track metrics differentlyâ€”for example, based on the creation date or including all transactions, not just accepted ones.
* * In the current dataset, a store's transaction date can be earlier than its creation date. This is due to generated test data; in real data, this would not occur.
* * Consequently, the average time for a store to perform its first five transactions can appear negative.
* * Stores with fewer than five transactions have been excluded from the analysis.
